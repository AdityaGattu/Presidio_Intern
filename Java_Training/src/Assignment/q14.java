	The public static void main(String ar[]) method is the entry point 
	of the execution in Java. When we run a .class file JVM searches for 
	the main method and executes the contents of it line by line.

	You can write the main method in your program without the static modifier, 
	the program gets compiled without compilation errors. 

	But, at the time of execution JVM does not consider 
	this new method (without static) as the entry point of the program. 
	It searches for the main method which is public, static, with return type void, 
			and a String array as an argument.
