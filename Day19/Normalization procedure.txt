Normalisation steps
1. List out all the fields in the invoice.
invno - pk
invdate
customerid
customername
customeraddress
discount
The moment you have a set of fields,  imediately find a unique key (a key which can be used as an identity)
identifying the primary key
Remove all the calcuated fields.
From the list of the fields, identify those fields whose field value getting added multiple times in the same invoice and make them as a seperate table.
invno - pk
itemid - pk
qty
The moment you have a seperate table, identify a linking key between the two tables
now again find out the primary key for this new table
since no key is unique - we go for composite key
the momemnt you have a composite key
Identify those fields which are partially dependent on the composite key, or more dependant on any one key
remove those  fields and make them as a seperate table
itemid - pk
itemdesc
unit
price
the new table needs a linking key
identify the primarykey
Now go back to the first table, identify all those fields which are not fully dependent on the primary key
customer id- pk
customername
customeraddress
find  the linking key
identify the primary key
